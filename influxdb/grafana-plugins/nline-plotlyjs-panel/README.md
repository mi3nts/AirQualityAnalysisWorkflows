# Plotly Panel

Render charts with [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/).

A maintained fork of [ae3e-plotly-panel](https://github.com/ae3e/ae3e-plotly-panel) with:

- Updated Plotly.js package
- Ability to export plot as image (fixed)
- Expandable code editors
- YAML support
- Updated dependencies
- Depreciated packages/code removed
- Linting, style standardization, code correction
- Better documentation
- and more!

Unlike the [natel-plotly-panel](https://github.com/NatelEnergy/grafana-plotly-panel), this plugin is not limited to specific types of charts. This plugin allows fine grained control over the `data`, `layout`, and`config` parameters used to build a Plotly plot.

## Getting started

The _Data_, _Layout_ and _Config_ fields match the common parameters described in [Plotly's documentation](https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-function-reference/). They must be in JSON format as described [by this schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/plotly.js/master/dist/plot-schema.json), however they are parsed and interpreted as YAML for ease of use in development. These fields are consumed by Plotly `{ data: [traces], layout: layout, config: config }` and produce a Plotly graph within the panel. They can be collapsed, expanded (by dragging) and used to format the contents (like VSCode).

Data provided by the data source can be transformed via a user-defined script before being delivered to the Plotly chart. This `script` section includes 2 implicit variables that can be used:

- `data`: Data returned by the datasource query. See the example below for the object's schema.
- `variables`: Object that contains [Grafana's dashboard variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/) available in the current dashboard (user variables as well as a few global variables: `__from`, `__to`, `__interval` and `__interval_ms`).
- `parameters`: The panel's data, layout, and config objects. This may be helpful in the case of applying static properties from the data panel (as one item rather than an array) across many traces via something like a merge.

The script must return an object with one or more of the following properties:

- `data`
- `layout`
- `config`
- `frames`

**Note:** The `data` and `frames` properties are arrays of dictionaries/JSON and must begin with a dash (as per YAML specs) or added as an array in the return of the function. However, the `data` field can be an object in which case it will apply the parameters to all of the returned traces in the _Script_ section.

For example:

```javascript
let x = data.series[0].fields[0].values.buffer;
let y = data.series[0].fields[1].values.buffer;

let series = {
  x: x,
  y: y,
  name: variables.dash_var,
  // where 'dash_var' is the name of
  // a Grafana dashboard variable
};

return {
  data: [series],
  config: {
    displayModeBar: false,
  },
};
```
